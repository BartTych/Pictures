generate list of all picture files

#one core
list_of_pictures = []
list_of_movies = []
# multiprocessing since hash generation is quite computationaly demanding 
picteres = [(hash,ext)]

# removing duplicates logic done by one processor

if heic && heic
    tolerance <= 2
# copy of the file in different archives
logic check metadata and remove file without it

if jpeg && jpeg
    tollerance depend on resolution difference
        for same resolutions:
            teleranec <= 2
        for different resolutions:
            tolerance <= 4

            metadata check 
# copy of the file in different archives 
# copy can have different resolution
logic when the same resolution remove the one without metadata 
    when smaller have meta and larger do not ask user !!
    when larger have meta remove smaller 

if heic && jpeg 
    tolerance = have to check that !!
    metadata check

# some files in heic are converted to jpeg during downloading
logic 

***
aditionally I will do a test for that by putting some series of files in a folder and checking if result is as expected. 


movie processing

as it was done before
    removing files with same meta and size
    or removing files with same name and size
